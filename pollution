How to classify fresh water polution:
  here is a good source: http://www.greenfacts.org/en/water-resources/figtableboxes/5.htm
  •organic matter...industrial wastewater and domestic sewage.
  •Pathogens and microbial contaminants...Domestic sewage, cattle and other livestock, natural sources.
  •Nutrients...Principally runoff from agricultural lands and urban areas but also from some industrial discharge.
  •Salinization... Leached from alkaline soils by over irrigation or by over-pumping coastal aquifers resulting in saltwater intrusion.
  •Acidification...(precipitation or runoff)...Sulphur, Nitrogen oxides and particulates from electric power generation, industrial stack and auto/truck emissions (wet and dry deposition). Acid mine drainage from tailings as well as mines.
  •Heavy metals...Industries and mining sites.
  •Toxic organic compounds and micro-organic pollutants...Wide variety of sources from industrial sites, automobiles, farmers, home gardeners, municipal wastewaters.
  •Thermal...Fragmentation of rivers by dams and reservoirs slowing water and allowing it to warm. Industry from cooling towers and other end-of-pipe above-ambient temperature discharges
  •Silt and suspended particles...Natural soil erosion, agriculture, road building, deforestation, construction and other land use changes.
